# Waves Book

## Idea

This repository will contain content for a book about Waves. The book is aimed primarily at developers and is a practical book that more covers the issues of working with the blockchain and the development of decentralized applications, rather than the development of the Waves protocol itself.

This book is built on the principles of Learning-by-doing and contains a large number of examples that are considered within the framework of the book. Before reading this book, it is recommended.

The structure of the book is described in the [Structure](./structure.md) file
