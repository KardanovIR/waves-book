# Approximate book structure

The structure of the book is in the mode of constant edits, the primary source of the structure is the directories in [sections](./sections).

## 1. Introduction to the Waves blockchain

The section tells about the history of the protocol, describes the main features of the protocol and how it differs from other blockchains. The basic principles of work in the section are not affected, since it is implied that the reader is either already familiar with them, or can familiarize himself with the course on Ð¡oursera. Section structure:

### [1.1 History of Waves](./sections/1-Waves-Introduction/1-1-history-of-waves.md)

### [1.2 Approaches to Waves Protocol Development](./sections/1-Waves-Introduction-2-development-principles.md)

### [1.3 Distinctive features of the Waves blockchain](./sections/1-Waves-Introduction/1-3-features-and-USPs.md)

## 2. Important features of the Waves network protocol

This section focuses on how Waves works at the level of the network protocol and node interaction. This section focuses on how the Waves networking protocol can impact the dApp development experience on the platform.

### [2.1 The Waves node and how it works, its configuration](./sections/2-Network-Features/2-1-node-configuration.md)

### [2.2 Mining Process (Waves NG)](./sections/2-Network-Features/2-2-mining-and-waves-ng.md)

### [2.3 Protocol updates and other polls](./sections/2-Network-Features/2-3-upgrades-and-other-votings.md)

## 3. Waves Accounts

This section explains how to create Waves accounts in and out of a node. This section does NOT cover cryptography related issues.

### [3.1 Keys in the Waves blockchain](./sections/3-Accounts/3-1-keys.md)

What is a seed phrase and how is it related to a key, why is a seed phrase of exactly this length, is it possible to pick it up. The private key, public key, and address, as they are related. How an account appears on the blockchain.

### [3.2 Regular accounts vs. smart accounts](./sections/3-Accounts/3-2-accounts-vs-smart-accounts.md)
