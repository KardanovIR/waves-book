# 1.2 Development principles of the Waves protocol

The developers of the Waves protocol have always been guided by some basic principles that strongly influence the further development of the protocol. Understanding these principles and the motivation behind them will make it easier to follow the further development of the project, so I will list these features.

## Blockchain for people

The Waves mantra has long been "Blockchain for the people". It fully reflected and reflects what the team is doing. The main thing the platform wants to achieve is ** popularize blockchain technology for the masses **. At the moment, blockchain is a technology for a very small group of people who understand what this technology is and how to use it correctly. Waves wants to change this state of affairs and ensure that technology brings the maximum benefit to everyone.

Many people think that blockchain technology is extremely complex and knowledge-intensive (in many ways it is), while Waves tries to hide all the complexity behind a simple layer of abstraction. Blockchain is not the most user-friendly database, which has several important properties: decentralization, immutability and openness. These features are not values ​​in themselves, but only if applied correctly by developers of specific applications. Waves' goal is to provide the tools to developers that will enable them to deliver value to end users faster, easier, without too much technical immersion.

We can say that the principle of orientation towards real application breaks down into several steps:

1. The platform provides application developers with an easy tool to use blockchain features
2. Application developers make products that solve user problems and use blockchain correctly
3. Users get the benefits of blockchain. At the same time, it is not necessary that users know anything about the blockchain. The main thing is to solve their problem.

## Focus on practical applicability

Always, during the development of a new functionality or product, ** practical applicability ** is at the forefront and how many people **potentially** will be able to solve their problems using this. The protocol developers try not to make "spaceships", solve "spherical problems in a vacuum" or over-engineer, choosing the applicability "here and now". It's better to have it working now than perfect in 10 years. Of course, this principle should not conflict with network security.

## Openness of development

The Waves protocol is completely open and the development process is as decentralized as possible. All source codes are available on [Github](https://github.com/wavesplatform). In addition to the source code itself, the development of the protocol, various problems and options for their solution are discussed there. Protocol updates related to consensus changes are always discussed with [Waves Enhancement Proposals](https://forum.wavesplatform.com/t/wep-0-waves-enhancement-proposal-unified-proposal-system/14781) ... But the discussion is only the first stage, because all consensus updates must still go through the activation procedure with a vote, which we will talk about in the next section. Now you know what to do if you want to change or add something in the protocol.
