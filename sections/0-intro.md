# Introduction

This book can help you make your first Web3 application on the Waves blockchain as quickly as possible, avoiding fatal mistakes. This book focuses on examples, analysis of real cases, specific recipes that you can apply in your applications. But as with many aspects of life, getting to real-world tasks requires fundamental knowledge of the protocol. Therefore, the first three chapters talk about the specifics of Web3 and the Waves blockchain, how it differs from other blockchains, along with a discussion of "what" and "how" can affect the architecture of your application and what limitations there may be. The book focuses on the specifics of working with Web3 applications on Waves, but not on basic concepts like "what is blockchain?" and "how does the consensus algorithm work?", since there is a huge amount of materials on how the blockchain works, while finding the features of individual protocols, examples and recipes is quite problematic.

It is important to understand that the book is also not a "complete guide" to Waves, as it focuses on the applied aspects of the protocol. It does not try to compete with the [protocol documentation](https://docs.wavesplatform.com), which has been around for a long time and covers many aspects of working with Waves.

After reading this book, you will be able to write smart contracts in the Ride language, understand the features of the Waves platform, and make your first decentralized Web 3 application.
