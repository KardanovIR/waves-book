# Conclusion

The world of Web3 applications, blockchains and decentralized systems is actively developing, more and more new interesting solutions and ideas appear in the community, so it is not possible to cover all the features of Web3 applications or the Waves platform within one book (or even three). At the same time, the knowledge gained in this book will help you to start developing applications on the Waves protocol as quickly as possible, design the architecture correctly, and find the right resources for further immersion.

I wish you to enjoy creating your first (or maybe not the first) working decentralized app on Waves. Blockchain platforms lack applications that can attract a large number of users, so I want your application to be just that and be able to change user habits and ultimately make people's lives better.

If you would like to continue exploring the Waves Protocol or would like to be directly involved in its development, I invite you to visit the [Waves Protocol](https://github.com/wavesplatform) Github page and take the course [Mastering Web3 With Waves on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mastering-web3-waves)
